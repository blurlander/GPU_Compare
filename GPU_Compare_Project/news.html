                    upon the world AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution [1], probably one
                    of our most anticipated technologies ever. On June 22, we announced that FSR was available in 7
                    games on the day of launch, with 12 more games coming with FSR in the future, and we are delighted
                    with the positive reception everyone has given FSR. Today, we have some more exciting news, with
                    more games getting FSR support, the release of FSR for developers on GPUOpen, and FSR support in
                    Unity and Unreal® Engine.</p>

                    We know that many of you are loving our cutting-edge spatial upscaling technology and using it to
                    boost your framerates while still enjoying high-quality, high-resolution experiences in games like
                    Anno 1800, Godfall, and DOTA 2, and today we’re super excited to announce that even more games are
                    getting FSR starting tomorrow, July 16.</p>

                <hr style="color: white;">
                <p class="p-news">If you are a game developer, since our announcement on June 22, you’ve probably been
                    counting the
                    days until you can get access to FSR and integrate it into your game, and the time has now come!
                    Starting today on GPUOpen, you can get access to the AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution source code for
                    free under the open source MIT License, get FSR documentation, and download a new sample that shows
                    off FSR and lets you view the different FSR modes and see how they impact image quality and
                    performance.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p-news">With this release, you can also have a look behind the scenes as to how FSR works and
                    see how easy it
                    is to implement FSR into your game project to get a boost in performance. This boost can help you
                    create next-generation gaming experiences that can support a wide range of hardware and deliver high
                    framerates for as broad an audience of gamers as possible.</p>

                    deep learning neural network that boosts frame rates and generates beautiful, sharp images for your
                    games. It gives you the performance headroom to maximize ray tracing settings and increase output
                    resolution. DLSS is powered by dedicated AI processors on RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores.</p>

                    couldn't just run it on anything. Since then DLSS has been improved and released in the form of DLSS
                    2.0. The company has also tried to make it more accessible to developers so that it doesn't need to
                    be trained on particular games in order to give the best performance but instead could be more
                    widely integrated into as many games as possible. </p>

                <h4 style="color: white;">What is DLSS and how does it work?</h4>
                <hr style="color: white;">
                <p class="p-news">Deep Learning Super Sampling (aka DLSS) is an artificial intelligence technology that
                    Nvidia has developed in order to help improve the performance of your gaming machine even while
                    you're running higher settings. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="p-news">The idea is to put less pressure on your GPU by rendering the original image at a
                    lower resolution, then using artificial intelligence to upscale that image to give the impression
                    it's being run at a higher resolution.

                    Imagine you're playing a visually stunning triple-A title on maximum settings on a 4K monitor but
                    the game is actually running at 1080p, then being upscaled by the AI to 4K using DLSS. This means
                    the game can run faster and smoother giving you large FPS gains but without the visuals suffering.

                    The DLSS artificial intelligence is essentially adding in the extra pixels to result in a fantastic
                    view but one that's smooth and won't leave you crying over the FPS counter dropping.

                    DLSS isn't perfect, but it has improved over time and now Nvidia has multiple DLSS settings that
                    include performance, balanced and quality mode. You can swap between these based on your experience
                    with quality offering the best visual enhancements while performance can help to up your FPS if it
                    looks like it's dropping. </p>
